# dagre-d3-webpack - A D3-based renderer for dagre

*This fork is just dagre-d3@0.4.17 with fixed `require`-calls to play nicely along with webpack*

[Dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to lay out directed graphs on
the client-side. The dagre-d3 library acts as a front-end to dagre, providing
actual rendering using [D3](http://d3js.org).

For more details, including examples and configuration options, please see our
[wiki](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3/wiki).
